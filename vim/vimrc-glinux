" Enable file type based indent configuration and syntax highlighting.
" Note that when code is pasted via the terminal, vim by default does not detect
" that the code is pasted (as opposed to when using vim's paste mappings), which
" leads to incorrect indentation when indent mode is on.
" To work around this, use ":set paste" / ":set nopaste" to toggle paste mode.
" You can also use a plugin to:
" - enter insert mode with paste (https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired)
" - auto-detect pasting (https://github.com/ConradIrwin/vim-bracketed-paste)
